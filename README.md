ScriptureExplorer is a web-based platform enabling seamless navigation and search across religious texts including the Bible and Quran. Built with ASP.NET Core Web API, it provides intuitive verse lookup, chapter navigation, and advanced search capabilities. 
The system serves as a digital bridge for scriptural study, offering clean API responses and a responsive interface for both desktop and mobile users.

ScriptureExplorer develops a multilingual scripture exploration platform similar to BibleGetaway and Quran.com, enabling users to read, search, and compare verses in Arabic, English, and Turkish. 
Built with ASP.NET Core (C#) for the backend and React for the frontend, it offers fast verse lookup, translation alignment, bookmarking, and user-friendly navigation. 

The innovative aspect lies in combining cross-language parallel text visualization with modern search technology for religious study. Risks include managing large multilingual datasets and ensuring accurate verse alignment. 
Expected outcomes are a responsive, accessible web app that supports personal and academic scripture research. The target users are students, educators, translators, and general readers interested in comparative religious texts and multilingual spiritual study.
